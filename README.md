# Spark Servlet Example

This is a simple example of a Spark (Java Micro MVC Framework) application running in a servlet container, namely Jetty.  It is fully set up to run on Heroku, & you can view it running at http://spark-servlet.herokuapp.com/.

## Running Locally

The easiest way to run the example is to type `mvn jetty:run` in the terminal.  Alternatively, you can use the same Jetty runner that is used on Heroku by typing in `java -jar target/dependency/jetty-runner.jar target/*.war`.

## Contributions

As everyone says, GitHub is about social coding - I didn't just choose to use it because of my love of git as a version control system.  Please do chip in & help make this even better.
